# turretGame

Turretgame project from Udemy course by Laurence Svekis. Featuring basic javascript functions. I've put my own twist on the project by replacing characters with pictures of my instructor (as the turret) and my classmates (bad buys.) I also increased the playing field size and decreased the number of bad guys to adjust for the larger bad guys, and also centered the playing field and added background image of my classroom. Created at Untapped Bootcamp.
